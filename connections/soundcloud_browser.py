"""Browser-based SoundCloud fetch for content the OAuth API can't reach.

SoundCloud's `/discover/sets/personalized-tracks::user:id` URLs only exist on
the internal `api-v2.soundcloud.com` host, which doesn't accept OAuth bearer
tokens (every Authorization variant returns 403). The web app accesses them
via a logged-in browser session cookie.

We avoid asking you to log in twice by importing your existing SoundCloud
session cookies from Brave's cookie store (read-only, works while Brave is
running) and injecting them into a fresh Playwright context. Playwright
navigates to the URL, the page issues its api-v2 XHR using the imported
session, and our response listener captures the playlist payload.
