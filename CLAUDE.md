Guidance to Claude Code for this repository.

## Project Overview

Unified DJ tool. Builds a fully-analysed track library by progressively enriching each track with Beatport metadata, DJ Studio analysis, and rekordbox phrase tags. Then any SQL-curated subset can be pushed to a Beatport playlist, a rekordbox playlist, or a DJ Studio mix.

All tool-generated files live under `~/Music/dj/` (DB at `dj.db`, per-command logs at `logs/<cmd>/`, state at `state/`, etc). `paths.py` is the single source of truth and auto-migrates old locations on first import.

See `README.md` for the full pipeline narrative + flag reference. This file only covers things that aren't obvious from reading the code.

## Key Design Decisions

### Enrichment pipeline (detect + sync)

- **Two enriched tables, no mirror** — `enriched_tracks` carries everything Beatport-derived (basic search-result fields + the 6 catalog-detail extras). `enriched_tracks_analysis` is sparse: keyed on `beatport_id`, holds DJ Studio analysis (`mik_key`, `mik_nrg`, per-stem `*_avg`/`*_peak`, `analysis_json` with full energy segments + 1Hz stem curves + per-segment stem RMS) + rekordbox PSSI (`rk_analysis_json`) + per-stage timestamps. A row exists in the analysis table only after `studio-analyse` has populated it. Joins (e.g., `enriched_tracks LEFT JOIN enriched_tracks_analysis USING(beatport_id)`) build the full picture at query time.
- **Beatport metadata in one place** — Full track-detail (label, ISRC, mix_name, sub_genre, length_ms, catalog_number) is fetched **only** in `detect/enrich.py` (and inline-extracted from playlist responses by `detect/sync_beatport.py`) and lands directly on `enriched_tracks`. Stages 5 and 6 must not call Beatport. Reason: `studio-analyse` already runs a long Node helper; an extra Beatport client + token-refresh path there is what caused the prior mid-run token-expiry incident.
- **studio-analyse writes only to our DB** — Stage 5 calls `upsert_analysis(beatport_id, fields)` to populate `enriched_tracks_analysis` (stamps `dj_studio_at` on insert). DJ Studio's filesystem is never touched. The skip-rule for re-runs is "row exists in `enriched_tracks_analysis` for this beatport_id" (override with `--force`); for ad-hoc reruns of specific tracks pass `--ids ID,ID,...`. SDK output was previously verified byte-for-byte against DJ Studio's stored values: mikKey/mikEnergy/BPM/duration/beat-count/energy segments all match exactly. The two divergences DJ Studio applies (rounded BPM, segment merging, cue-point trimming, BP-key override of mikKey for certain tracks) are display-time post-processing — we keep the fuller raw signal.
- **JWT auto-refresh** — DJ Studio's access JWT lives ~60 min; long runs hit expiry. On a 401 from `cf.dj.studio`, `studio-analyse` re-decrypts `encryptedToken-v2.dat`, re-exchanges via `app-services.dj.studio`, and pushes the fresh JWT down to the running Node helper via the `setAccessJwt` command (defined in `dj_studio_sdk.js`). No helper restart, no model reload. Hard-abort only fires if the post-refresh retry ALSO 401s — at that point `encryptedToken-v2.dat` itself is invalid and only "open DJ Studio, sign in" can fix it.
- **mark_pipeline_done only handles rekordbox stamps** — `dj_studio_at` is set by `upsert_analysis`, not by the caller. Valid columns are `rekordbox_export_at` (Stage 6a) and `rekordbox_analysis_at` (Stage 6b). Passing anything else raises.
- **DJ Studio analysis is headless via SDK** — `detect/studio_sdk.py` decrypts DJ Studio's local refresh token (AES-256-CBC, hardcoded key in `encryptedToken-v2.dat`), exchanges it for a JWT via `app-services.dj.studio`, then drives `dj_studio_sdk.js` (a long-running Node helper that loads `@appmachine/beatport-sdk` + `@appmachine/ai-stems` (Demucs) + `@appmachine/ai-beatgrid` + the MIK WASM extractor and calls `cf.dj.studio/mixedinkey/analyze`). The Demucs model weights live at `~/Library/Application Support/DJ.Studio/extensions/djs-stems/models/htdemucs_fast_encrypted.pt` — installed by DJ Studio itself, shared by us. DJ Studio must be quit (port 61894 + `.beatport/` cache locks).
- **Stem curves + per-segment RMS** — the Node helper computes per-1024-sample-bucket RMS (~23ms resolution) per stem when running Demucs and ships them back as base64 uint16. `_shape_result` decodes them into (a) `stems[stem].curve_1hz` — one mean RMS per second of audio, ~300 floats per stem for a 5-min track, used for "where does X come in?" queries — and (b) `stems[stem].per_segment` — index-aligned with `energy.segments[]`, for "vocals during the chorus" queries. Both live in `analysis_json`.
- **No phrase labels from DJ Studio** — DJ Studio's `track-structures-table.phraseData` is always empty (the renderer never calls the dormant ML phrase model). Real semantic phrase labels (Intro/Verse/Chorus/Outro/Up/Down/Bridge) come exclusively from Stage 6's rekordbox PSSI tag.
- **Rekordbox round-trip = three steps** — `export-to-rekordbox` pushes bare Beatport streaming entries (`FileType=20`) into a named playlist with no cue points (those would shadow rekordbox's own analysis output). Manual: open rekordbox → right-click playlist → Analyze Tracks. Then `import-rekordbox-analysis` reads PSSI + PCO2/PCOB into `rk_analysis_json`. Both stages JOIN `enriched_tracks_analysis` with `enriched_tracks` for the artist/title/key/bpm fields they need.
- **Beatport access token refresh** — `BEATPORT_ACCESS_TOKEN` ~10 min, `BEATPORT_SESSION_TOKEN` ~32 days. The session token auto-refreshes the access token on 401. Don't add manual refresh wrappers around individual stages. `connections/beatport.refresh_via_session(verbose=True)` (or `BEATPORT_DEBUG=1`) prints the real cause when refresh fails — usually means the persistent browser profile at `~/Music/dj/state/browser-profile/` needs wiping so `--ui` can do a clean re-login.
- **Stage 1 (sync) cursor** — `--library` mode tracks the last `library_added_date` processed in the `cursors` table; re-runs only handle new Apple Music additions. `synced_tracks` keeps per-track outcome (`added` / `duplicate` / `fuzzy_miss` / `no_classify`) so a track is never reprocessed.
- **`connections/cookies.py` is the single cookie reader** — wraps `browser_cookie3` to support Brave, Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Firefox, Safari. Two helpers: `read_cookies_for_domain(domain, browser)` returns Playwright-shaped dicts (used by `connections/soundcloud_browser.py` and `connections/beatport.capture_session_from_brave()`); `load_cookie_jar(domain, browser)` returns an `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` (used by `detect/tracklists1001_api.py` for httpx). `helpers/download_course.py` is intentionally separate — it sniffs Dyntube AES key bytes from a live Playwright context, not cookies, so the static-cookie path doesn't apply.
- **`detect 1001tracklists` uses Brave cookies by default** — `detect/tracklists1001_api.py` POSTs to `export_data.php` with cookies loaded via `connections/cookies.load_cookie_jar`. On any failure it falls back to the vi-paste path automatically. `--paste` forces vi; `--browser {brave,chrome,safari,firefox}` selects the source profile (no auto-fallback chain — if Brave fails, re-run with `--browser chrome`).
- **yt-dlp cookie auth (YouTube/SoundCloud fallback)** — `detect/youtube.py` uses `--cookies-from-browser BROWSER` live (never a cached Netscape file) because yt-dlp 2025 requires a **po_token** (Proof-of-Origin Token) that is only available from a live browser session; a static cookie file causes YouTube to return "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" even with valid session cookies. Browsers are tried in order (Brave → Chrome → Safari → Firefox); the first one that works is cached in `~/Music/dj/state/yt_browser.txt` for a week. On bot detection, the next browser in `_BROWSERS` is tried automatically. If all browsers fail, the error tells the user to log in to YouTube in one of them. Never hardcode a single browser name — the ordered fallback list lives in `_BROWSERS`.
- **`fix-session` safe-delete rules** — `db.remove_tracks_from_session` unlinks a track from a session and deletes it from `detected_tracks` only when all three conditions hold: (a) no other `track_sessions` row references it, (b) no `enriched_tracks` row has it as `detected_track_id`, and (c) its `source` is not `'beatport'`. This means enriched tracks and Beatport-sourced tracks are never deleted, only unlinked.
- **caffeinate on long-running commands** — `caffeinate.py` (top-level) provides a `caffeinate()` context manager that runs `caffeinate -i` to prevent macOS idle sleep. Applied to: `detect studio-analyse` (Node SDK analysis, ~23s/track, can run hours over a full library), `detect enrich` (sequential Beatport API calls, can run 20+ min on large libraries), `detect radio-garden` (indefinite monitoring loop). The macOS power assertion is released automatically when the `caffeinate` process exits. Not needed for fast filesystem-only commands (`import-rekordbox-analysis`, `export-to-rekordbox`).

### Discovery (detect gems)

- **`detect gems` review flow — nothing is saved without approval** — after a scan, `review_gems` walks the found tracks one at a time, printing each track's link so the user can listen, then prompts approve / reject / skip / quit. Only **approved** tracks are persisted to `detected_tracks` (via the normal `insert_track` dedup path, so they flow into `enrich` like any other detected track) — that write also creates a `sessions` row (`type='gems'`, synthetic `gems://<source>/<genre>?t=<iso>` URL to satisfy the `UNIQUE(url)` constraint) + a `gem_scans` row + per-track `gem_tracks` rows. **Rejected** tracks go to the `rejected_gems` table instead and never enter the pipeline. **Skipped/undecided** tracks aren't persisted anywhere, so they can reappear in a later scan. `--no-save` shows the results table and skips review entirely (testing only).
- **Cross-run dedup is content-based, not offset-based** — platform results reshuffle over time, so the next run can't trust a page offset. `db.seen_gem_keys(source, cutoff)` + `db.seen_rejected_gem_keys(source, cutoff)` build a combined exclude set of prior approved + rejected `(artist, title)` keys, and each search pages until `--count` *new* tracks are collected. Both approved and rejected gems with a release date older than the current `--date` cutoff are "faded" (dropped from the comparison set — they can't recur in a window that excludes them anyway); `gem_tracks` and `rejected_gems` are both indexed on `(source, release_date)` for this. Dedup is per-platform — safe because `enrich`'s `upsert_enriched` collapses cross-platform duplicates by `beatport_id`.
- **Per-platform gem signal differs** — Beatport filters by exact `genre_id` (only authoritative genre source) and drops Hype (label-paid promotion) tracks since it has no public play count; SoundCloud filters `playback_count < 5000`; Spotify mines editorial playlists by `popularity` (its `genre:` search filter is unreliable for sub-genres); Bandcamp filters by uploader `tag_norm_names` via `discover/1/discover_web` (the older `discover/3/get_web` silently ignored the tag param, returning every genre). Genre IDs / tag mappings live in `detect/gems.py` — extend `_BEATPORT_GENRE_IDS` / `GENRES` to add genres.

### Apps (`dj course`)

- **`apps/<name>/cli.py` pattern** — each frontend app gets a sibling Python CLI that's mounted into `dj_cli.py` as a top-level subcommand (`dj course start/stop`). `apps/` is a Python package (has `__init__.py`) and must be listed in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` `include` array, otherwise the installed `dj` script in `.venv/bin/` raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apps'` even though `uv run dj_cli.py` works.
- **portless wrapping** — `dj course start` runs `npx portless course npm run dev` in a new process group (`start_new_session=True` so `pid == pgid`; stop kills the whole group with `os.killpg`). Portless picks a free port, sets `PORT=<port> HOST=127.0.0.1` env vars, then exec's the dev command. `apps/course/vite.config.ts` reads those env vars (`process.env.PORT/HOST`) so vite binds to portless's port; if vite ignores them (the default) the proxy gets a 502 because portless registers one port and vite picks another.
- **stdout piped to a log file, not DEVNULL** — portless detects the dev server's URL by parsing its stdout. If we redirect to `subprocess.DEVNULL` portless can't see the "Local: …" line and ends up routing to a random port → 502. The CLI redirects to `~/Music/dj/logs/course/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` so portless still sees the output. After startup the URL is extracted from the same log with a `-> https://…` regex and saved to `~/Music/dj/state/course_url.txt` for `_get_url()`. `npx portless get <name>` is **not** used — in a git worktree it returns a worktree-prefixed URL (`https://minsk-v10.course.localhost:1355`) that portless never actually registers a route for, so it 404s.
- **Service install is optional** — without `npx portless service install` the proxy runs on port 1355 (no root needed) and URLs include `:1355`. With it, port 443 binds at boot and URLs go port-free (`https://course.localhost`). The CLI prints a hint when the port shows in the URL; nothing breaks if you ignore it.
- **Broken courses don't black-hole the app** — vite's dev server returns `200 + index.html` (SPA fallback) for missing files in `publicDir`, so a broken symlink (e.g. unmounted external drive at `~/Music/dj/dj-academy → /Volumes/My Passport/…`) makes `JSON.parse(lessons.json)` throw "Unexpected token '<'". `lessonsStore.loadLessons` checks `Content-Type` and treats non-JSON 200s as missing; `main.tsx` boot walks `courses.json` in order and skips courses that fail to load, so one missing drive doesn't crash the viewer.

### playlist (SQL → destination)

- **Stage 6a (`detect export-to-rekordbox`) and `playlist rekordbox` share the same core** — `playlist.to_rekordbox.push_to_rekordbox(rows, name)` does the writing. Stage 6a wraps it with the `rekordbox_export_at IS NULL` pending-query and an `on_added` callback to stamp the timestamp. `playlist rekordbox` calls the same function with no callback — pure ad-hoc curation, no pipeline-stamp side effects.
- **User SQL must return `beatport_id`** — `playlist.query.run_user_query` validates the query starts with `SELECT` (the only check; the column-shape error fires after fetch if `beatport_id` isn't in the result set). After exec, `fetch_full_rows` re-fetches via `enriched_tracks LEFT JOIN enriched_tracks_analysis USING(beatport_id)` so push code always has artist/title/genre/key/bpm/length_ms regardless of how the user wrote their SQL. The query runs with the connection's full DB privileges — this tool assumes the user owns the database.
- **No DJ Studio writes from this tool** — the previous `playlist dj-studio` destination wrote `projects-table/<uuid>` + `projects-meta-table/<uuid>` files, but DJ Studio also tracks per-mix UI state in IndexedDB (`~/Library/Application Support/DJ.Studio/IndexedDB/local-web_*.indexeddb.leveldb/`) that we couldn't write to — meaning UI delete was a no-op for tool-created mixes (the right-click → Delete flow looks up the IndexedDB row, doesn't find it, silently fails). We removed the destination rather than ship a half-working write path. DJ Studio is now read-only for this tool: we drive its SDK for analysis (`studio-analyse`) and read its library + projects-table for inspection only.
